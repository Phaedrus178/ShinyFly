# ShinyFly
#ShinyFly is a Shiny App I developed to simulate fly mating data for students as part of the Genetics lab course at Rutgers university.
You can use it to simulate Recessive, Dominant, or X-linked trait inheritance for a user determined number of offspring.
The data can then be used to create a lab report describing the inheritance of that specific trait.
